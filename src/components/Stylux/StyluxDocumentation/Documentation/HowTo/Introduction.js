            <P>I am working on a video series that will visually show how to use this library. This library was started after two weeks of learning javascript and Reactjs. I am very new to development, but love challenges. Stylux was created to challenge myself at a web development bootcamp, I used it to build my personal project. Currently I am expirimenting with three web apps to test if Stylux can be used in production.</P>
            <P>This is a very Alpha pstage project. When the themeing function through the Provider is implemented, I will open the library into Beta. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</P>
            <P>Have Fun</P>
